        <p class = "imgTxt">HTML was the start of my career. As I was interested on how websites were built I took an online course to learn this language. 
          It was then that my interest for coding and webdevelopment started. Click the icon to see  my very first website.</p>

        <p class = "imgTxt">Even though there was no javascript course in my study program, this language was part of some assignments. 
          These school tasks introduced this scripting language to me, and I continued to learn it through courses online. My bachelor thesis included a web app based on javascript.

        <a href="https://chat.adri001.repl.co" target="_blank"><img class = "image" src="./images/php.png" alt="PHP"></a>
        <p class = "imgTxt">PHP was the language learned in the Web Development course included in my study program. 
          In this course, I learned to use HTML and PHP, to develop web pages that include basic PHP concepts
          and different actions such as login and log out, database connection, and file management. </p>

        <p class = "imgTxt">
          At the school, programming was introduced with Python, in this course I learned the basic programming concepts. 
          My assignments included simple games such as tic-tac-toe and hangman. Later as part of the Machine Learning course, my Python skills were upgraded as I learned, 
          how to visualize data with Jupyter Notebooks. I learned to clean data, analyze it and present it in dashboards using tools such as Pandas, Numpy, MatplotLib, and Seaborn.
          When learning Agile Methodology, my team and I used Scrum to build a Brain teaser web application with Flask.

        <p class = "imgTxt">
          In the Database course, I learned how to design and manage a database, as well as how to perform basic queries.
          Along with the PHP course, I learned how to connect to a database and perform CRUD operations. 
          This also included sanitizing user inputs, to keep data safe.

        <img class = "image" src="./images/css.png" alt="CSS">
        <p class = "imgTxt">
          I have learned CSS on my own initiative. I started to play around with it and included it in my assignments even when it was not a requirement. 
          I think the visual aspect is very important and this tool has a lot of possibilities. I am continuously learning and improving my CSS skills and this portfolio is part of it.

        <img class = "image" src="./images/json-file.png" alt="JSON">
        <p class = "imgTxt">
          JSON has been part of some of my projects. The first time I used it was to retrieve data from a Bitcoin (BSV) API where I used node to store and retrieve data from the Blockchain.
          This tool has been used to store data on some of my web apps.

        <p class = "imgTxt">
          C# and OOP are new to me. I have taken self initiative and I'm currently studying this language.
